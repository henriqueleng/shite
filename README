shite - posix shell, static webpages generator.
===============================================

This is a simple static webpages generator made to build my personal site:
(http://www.henriquelengler.com)

It is made entirely posix shell + posix tools (sed, ls, wc, echo, cat
...), *if something fail in your system, please tell me*.

The only extra tools you will need is a markdown processor, and a text editor.

Installing
----------
Just edit the variables on the Makefile and run 

    # make install

Usage
-----

Info about usage, examples and other things on the manpage, please read it.
