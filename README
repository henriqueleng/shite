shite - posix shell, static webpages generator.
===============================================

This is a simple static webpages generator made to build my personal site:
(http://www.henriquelengler.com)

It is made entirely posix shell + posix tools (sed, ls, wc, echo, cat
...), *if something fail in your system, please tell me*.

The only extra tools you will need is a markdown processor, and a text editor.

Installing
----------
Just edit the variables on the Makefile and run 

    # make install

Usage
-----

Info about usage, examples and other things on the manpage, please read it.

Site style:
-----------
If your generated website is ugly, don't worry, editing the CSS file can solve 
all your problems. Read the generated files, to see the tags used and edit it.

Contat

Please send me patches, suggestions and any other things to: henriqueleng@openmailbox.org
